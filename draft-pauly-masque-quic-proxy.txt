                 QUIC-Aware Proxying Using CONNECT-UDP
                  draft-pauly-masque-quic-proxy-latest

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to the CONNECT-UDP HTTP method
   that adds specific optimizations for QUIC connections that are
   proxied.  This extension allows a proxy to reuse UDP 4-tuples for
   multiple connections.  It also defines a mode of proxying in which
   QUIC short header packets can be forwarded through the proxy rather
   than being re-encapsulated and re-encrypted.

1.  Introduction

   The CONNECT-UDP HTTP method [CONNECT-UDP] defines a way to send
   datagrams through an HTTP proxy, where UDP is used to communicate
   between the proxy and a target server.  This can be used to proxy
   QUIC connections [QUIC], since QUIC runs over UDP datagrams.

   This document uses the term "target" to refer to the server that a
   client is accessing via a proxy.  This target may be an origin
   hosting content, or another proxy.

Internet-Draft                 QUIC Proxy                   October 2020


   This document extends the CONNECT-UDP HTTP method to add signalling
   about QUIC Connection IDs.  QUIC Connection IDs are used to identify
   QUIC connections in scenarios where there is not a strict
   bidirectional mapping between one QUIC connection and one UDP 4-tuple
   (pairs of IP addresses and ports).  A proxy that is aware of
   Connection IDs can reuse UDP 4-tuples between itself and a target for
   multiple proxied QUIC connections.

   Awareness of Connection IDs also allows a proxy to avoid re-
   encapsulation and re-encryption of proxied QUIC packets once a
   connection has been established.  When this functionality is present,
   the proxy can support two modes for handling QUIC packets:

   1.  Tunnelled, in which client <-> target QUIC packets are
       encapsulated inside client <-> proxy QUIC packets.  These packets
       use multiple layers of encryption and congestion control.  QUIC
       long header packets MUST use this mode.  QUIC short header
       packets MAY use this mode.  This is the default mode for CONNECT-
       UDP.

   2.  Forwarded, in which client <-> target QUIC packets are sent
       directly over the client <-> proxy UDP socket.  These packets are
       only encrypted using the client-target keys, and use the client-
       target congestion control.  This mode MUST only be used for QUIC
       short header packets.

   Forwarding is defined as an optimization to reduce CPU processing on
   clients and proxies, as well as avoiding MTU overhead for packets on
   the wire.  This makes it suitable for deployment situations that
   otherwise relied on cleartext TCP proxies, which cannot support QUIC
   and have inferior security and privacy properties.

   The properties provided by the forwarding mode are as follows:

   *  All packets sent between the client and the target traverse
      through the proxy device.

   *  The target server cannot know the IP address of the client solely
      based on the proxied packets the target receives.

   *  Observers of either or both of the client <-> proxy link and the
      proxy <-> target are not able to learn more about the client <->
      target communication than if no proxy was used.

   It is not a goal of forwarding mode to prevent correlation between
   client <-> proxy and the proxy <-> target packets from an entity that
   can observe both links.  See Section 8 for futher discussion.

   Both clients and proxies can unilaterally choose to disable forwarded
   mode for any client <-> target connection.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Required Proxy State

   In the methods defined in this document, the proxy is aware of the
   QUIC Connection IDs being used by proxied connections, along with the
   UDP 4-tuples (local and remote IP addresses and ports) used to
   communicate with the client and the target.  Tracking Connection IDs
   in this way allows the proxy to reuse server-facing sockets for
   multiple connections and support the forwarding mode of proxying.

   A QUIC Connection ID identifies the receiver of a packet, and is
   chosen by the receiver.

   A Connection ID that is defined by the client of HTTP/3 proxy, and is
   used to route packets from the target server to the client when it is
   a Destination Connection ID, is referred to as the "Client Connection
   ID".

   A Connection ID that is defined by the target server accessed via an
   HTTP/3 proxy, and is used to route packets from the client to the
   target server when it is a Destination Connection ID, is referred to
   as the "Server Connection ID".

   QUIC packets can be either tunnelled within an HTTP/3 proxy
   connection using QUIC DATAGRAM frames, or be forwarded directly
   alongside an HTTP/3 proxy connection on the same set of IP addresses
   and UDP ports.  The use of forwarded mode requires the consent of
   both the client and the proxy.

   In order to correctly route QUIC packets in both tunnelled and
   forwarded modes, the proxy needs to maintain mappings between several
   items:

   *  Client <-> Proxy QUIC connection, which is a single QUIC
      connection established from the client to the proxy.

   *  Datagram flow ID, which represents a flow of HTTP/3 DATAGRAMs
      specific to a single client <-> proxy QUIC connection.

Internet-Draft                 QUIC Proxy                   October 2020


   *  Client-facing socket, which is the UDP 4-tuple of addresses and
      ports used to communicate between the client and the proxy.

   *  Server-facing socket, which is the UDP 4-tuple of addresses and
      ports used to communicate between the proxy and the target.

   *  Client Connection ID, which is a QUIC Connection ID used to route
      traffic to a client.

   *  Server Connection ID, which is a QUIC Connection ID used to route
      traffic to a target.

   Note that this document refers to UDP 4-tuples (local address, local
   port, remote address, remote port) as "sockets".  This is equivalent
   to a "connected" UDP socket.  Implementations will often use UDP
   socket APIs that only define the local port.

   There are three required unidirectional mappings, described below.

2.1.  Datagram Flow ID Mapping

   Each pair of client <-> proxy QUIC connection and datagram flow ID
   MUST be mapped to a single server-facing socket.

(Client <-> Proxy QUIC connection + Datagram flow ID) => Server-facing socket

   Multiple datagram flow IDs can map to the same server-facing socket,
   but a single datagram flow ID cannot be mapped to multiple server-
   facing sockets.

   This mapping guarantees that any QUIC packet using the datagram flow
   ID sent from the client to the proxy in tunnelled mode can be sent to
   the correct target.

2.2.  Server Connection ID Mapping

   Each pair of Server Connection ID and client-facing socket MUST map
   to a single server-facing socket.

   (Client-facing socket + Server Connection ID) => Server-facing socket

   Multiple pairs of Connection IDs and sockets can map to the same
   server-facing socket.

   This mapping guarantees that any QUIC packet containing the Server
   Connection ID sent from the client to the proxy in forwarded mode can
   be sent to the correct target.  Thus, a proxy that does not allow
   forwarded mode does not need to maintain this mapping.

Internet-Draft                 QUIC Proxy                   October 2020


2.3.  Client Connection ID Mappings

   Each pair of Client Connection ID and server-facing socket MUST map
   to a single datagram flow ID on a single client <-> proxy QUIC
   connection.  Additionally, the pair of Client Connection ID and
   server-facing socket MUST map to a single client-facing socket.

(Server-facing socket + Client Connection ID) => (Client <-> Proxy QUIC connection + Datagram flow ID)
(Server-facing socket + Client Connection ID) => Client-facing socket

   Multiple pairs of Connection IDs and sockets can map to the same
   datagram flow ID or client-facing socket.

   These mappings guarantee that any QUIC packet sent from a target to
   the proxy can be sent to the correct client, in either tunelled or
   forwarded mode.  Note that this mapping becomes trivial if the proxy
   always opens a new server-facing socket for every client request with
   a unique datagram flow ID.  The mapping is critical for any case
   where server-facing sockets are shared or reused.

2.4.  Detecting Connection ID Conflicts

   In order to be able to route packets correctly in both tunnelled and
   forwarded mode, proxies MUST check for conflicts before creating a
   new mapping.  If a conflict is detected, the proxy will reject a
   client request, as described in Section 5.

   Two sockets conflict only when the entire 4-tupe (local address,
   local port, remote address, and remote port) all are identical.

   Two Connection IDs conflict when one Connection ID is equal to or a
   prefix of another.  For example, a zero-length Connection ID
   conflicts with all other connection IDs.

   The proxy treats two mappings as being in conflict when a confict is
   detected for all elements on the left side of the mapping diagrams
   above.

3.  Connection ID Headers for CONNECT-UDP

   This document defines two headers that can be used in CONNECT-UDP
   requests and responses.  All other requirements defined for CONNECT-
   UDP [CONNECT-UDP] still apply.

   "Client-Connection-Id" is an Item Structured Header
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure], containing a client's QUIC
   Connection ID.  Its value MUST be a Byte Sequence.  The byte sequence
   MAY be zero-length.  Its ABNF is:

Internet-Draft                 QUIC Proxy                   October 2020


      Client-Connection-Id = sf-binary

   "Server-Connection-Id" is an Item Structured Header
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure], containing a target server's
   QUIC Connection ID.  Its value MUST be a Byte Sequence.  The byte
   sequence MAY be zero-length.  Its ABNF is:

      Server-Connection-Id = sf-binary

   Like the Datagram-Flow-Id header [CONNECT-UDP], the Client-
   Connection-Id and Server-Connection-Id headers can only be supported
   by an HTTP/3 proxy.  If a proxy does not support HTTP/3 datagrams
   [H3DGRAM], or it does not support the extension defined in this
   document, it MUST NOT send the Client-Connection-Id and Server-
   Connection-Id headers on any responses.  If a proxy does support this
   extension, it MUST echo the Client-Connection-Id and Server-
   Connection-Id headers on any 2xx (Successful) responses.  Clients
   that do not receive an echoed Client-Connection-Id or Server-
   Connection-Id header MUST fall back to using CONNECT-UDP without the
   extended behavior defined in this document.

4.  Client Request Behavior

   A client sends new CONNECT-UDP requests when it wants to start a new
   QUIC connection to a target, when it has received a new Server
   Connection ID for the target, and before it advertises a new Client
   Connection ID to the target.

   Each request MUST contain a Datagram-Flow-Id header and an authority
   pseudo-header identifying the target.  All requests for the same QUIC
   Connection between a client and a target MUST contain the same
   authority, and SHOULD contain the same Datagram-Flow-Id.  If there is
   Datagram-Flow-Id mismatch, the proxy will treat the requests as
   different proxied connections, which could appear as a migration or
   NAT rebinding event to the target.

   Each request MUST also contain exactly one connection ID header,
   either Client-Connection-Id or Server-Connection-Id.  Client-
   Connection-Id requests define paths for receiving packets from the
   target server to the client, and Server-Connection-Id requests define
   paths for sending packets from the client to target server.

4.1.  New Proxied Connection Setup

   The first time that a client uses a proxy for a given QUIC
   connection, it selects a new datagram flow ID with an even-numbered
   value [I-D.schinazi-quic-h3-datagram].




Pauly & Schinazi          Expires 19 April 2021                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 QUIC Proxy                   October 2020


   The first request the clients makes MUST contain the authority
   pseudo-header and the Datagram-Flow-Id and Client-Connection-Id
   headers, containing the selected datagram flow ID and the Client
   Connection ID that will be used in the initial QUIC packets sent
   through the proxy.

   The client can start sending packets tunnelled within DATAGRAM frames
   as soon as this first CONNECT-UDP request for the datagram flow ID
   has been sent, even in the same QUIC packet to the proxy.  That is,
   the QUIC packet sent from the client to the proxy can contain a
   STREAM frame containing the CONNECT-UDP request, as well as a
   DATAGRAM frame that contains a tunnelled QUIC packet to send to the
   target.  This is particularly useful for reducing round trips on
   connection setup.

   Since clients are always aware whether or not they are using a QUIC
   proxy, clients are expected to cooperate with proxies in selecting
   Client Connection IDs.  A proxy detects a conflict when it is not
   able to create a unique mapping using the Client Connection ID
   ({conflicts}).  It can reject requests that would cause a conflict
   and indicate this to the client by replying with a 409 (Conflict)
   status.  In order to avoid conflicts, clients SHOULD select Client
   Connection IDs of at least 8 bytes in length with unpredictable
   values.  A client also MUST NOT select a Client Connection ID that
   matches the ID used for the QUIC connection to the proxy, as this
   inherently creates a conflict.

   Note that packets sent in DATAGRAM frames before the proxy has sent
   its CONNECT-UDP response might be dropped if the proxy rejects the
   request.  Specifically, this can occur if the Client Connection ID
   causes a conflict and the proxy returns a 409 (Conflict) error.  Any
   DATAGRAM frames that are sent in a separate QUIC packet from the
   STREAM frame that contains the CONNECT-UDP request might also be
   dropped in the case that the packet arrives at the proxy before the
   packet containing the STREAM frame.

   If the server rejects the first request that uses a specific datagram
   flow ID, the client MUST retire that datagram flow ID.  If the
   rejection indicated a conflict due to the Client Connection ID, the
   client MUST select a new Connection ID before sending a new request,
   and generate a new packet.  For example, if a client is sending a
   QUIC Initial packet and chooses a Connection ID that conflicts with
   an existing mapping to the same target server, it will need to
   generate a new QUIC Initial.

Internet-Draft                 QUIC Proxy                   October 2020


4.2.  Adding New Client Connection IDs

   A client can add new Connection IDs to a proxied QUIC connection by
   sending a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame to the target.

   Prior to sending a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame to the target for a client
   Connection ID, the client MUST send a CONNECT-UDP request with the
   Client-Connection-Id header to the proxy, and only send the
   NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame once a 2xx (Successful) response is received.

4.3.  Sending With Forwarded Mode

   Once the client has learned the target server's Connection ID, such
   as in the response to a QUIC Initial packet, it can send a request
   containing the Server-Connection-Id header to request the ability to
   forward packets.  The client MUST wait for a successful (2xx)
   response before using forwarded mode.  Prior to receiving the server
   response, the client MUST send short header packets tunnelled in
   DATAGRAM frames.  The client MAY also choose to tunnel some short
   header packets even after receiving the successful response.

   If the client's request that included the Server-Connection-Id is
   rejected, for example with a 409 (Conflict) response, it MUST NOT
   forward packets to the requested Server Connection ID, but only use
   tunnelled mode.  The request might also be rejected if the proxy does
   not support forwarded mode or has it disabled by policy.  For any
   response code other than a 2xx success, the client MUST NOT retry a
   request for the same Server Connection ID.  For errors other than 409
   (Conflict), clients SHOULD stop sending requests for other Server
   Connection IDs in the future.

   QUIC long header packets MUST NOT be forwarded.  These packets can
   only be tunnelled within DATAGRAM frames to avoid exposing
   unnecessary connection metadata.

   When forwarding, the client sends a QUIC packet with the target
   server's Connection ID in the QUIC short header, using the same
   socket between client and proxy that was used for the main QUIC
   connection between client and proxy.

4.4.  Receiving With Forwarded Mode

   A proxy MUST NOT forward packets from the target to the client until
   after the client has sent at least one packet in forwarded mode.
   Once this occurs, the proxy MAY use forwarded mode for any Client
   Connection ID for which it has a valid mapping.

Internet-Draft                 QUIC Proxy                   October 2020


   If a client has started using forwarding mode, it MUST be prepared to
   receive forwarded short header packets on the socket between itself
   and the proxy for any Client Connection ID that has been accepted by
   the proxy.  The client uses the received Connection ID to determine
   if a packet was originated by the proxy, or merely forwarded from the
   target.

4.5.  Opting Out of Forwarded Mode

   The use of forwarded mode is initiated by the client sending a
   request with the Server-Connection-Id header and sending at least one
   forwarded packet to the proxy.  A client that does not wish to accept
   forwarded packets from the proxy when communicating with a specific
   target can simply not start forwarding packets to the proxy.

5.  Proxy Response Behavior

   Upon receipt of a CONNECT-UDP request that contains a Client-
   Connection-Id or Server-Connection-Id header, the proxy validates the
   request, tries to establish the appropriate mappings described in
   Section 2, and establishes a new server-facing socket if necessary.

   The proxy MUST validate that the request only contains one of either
   the Client-Connection-Id or the Server-Connection-Id header, along
   with a Datagram-Flow-Id header and an authority pseudo-header.  If
   any of these conditions is not met, the proxy MUST reject the request
   with a 400 (Bad Request) reponse.  The proxy also MUST reject the
   request if the requested datagram flow ID has already been used on
   that client <-> proxy QUIC connection with a different requested
   authority.

   The proxy then determines the server-facing socket to associate with
   the client's datagram flow.  This will generally involve performing a
   DNS lookup for the hostname in the request authority, or finding an
   existing server-facing socket to the authority.  The server-facing
   socket might already be open due to a previous request from this
   client, or another.  If the socket is not already created, the proxy
   creates a new one.  Proxies can choose to reuse server-facing sockets
   across multiple datagram flows, or have a unique server-facing socket
   for every datagram flow.

   If a proxy reuses server-facing sockets, it SHOULD store which
   authorities (which could be a domain name or IP address literal) are
   being accessed over a particular server-facing socket so it can avoid
   performing a new DNS query and potentially choosing a different
   server IP address which could map to a different server.

Internet-Draft                 QUIC Proxy                   October 2020


   If the request includes a Client-Connection-Id header, the proxy is
   receiving a request to be able to route traffic back to the client
   using that Connection ID.  If the pair of this Client Connection ID
   and the selected server-facing socket does not create a conflict, the
   proxy creates the mapping and responds with a 200 (OK) response.
   After this point, any packets received by the proxy from the server-
   facing socket that match the Client Connection ID can to be sent to
   the client.  The proxy MUST use tunnelled mode (DATAGRAM frames) on
   the correct datagram flow for any long header packets.  The proxy
   SHOULD forward directly to the client for any matching short header
   packets, but MAY tunnel them in DATAGRAM frames.  If the pair is not
   unique, or the proxy chooses not to support zero-length Client
   Connection IDs, the proxy responds with a 409 (Conflict) response.
   If this occurs on the first request for a given datagram flow, the
   proxy removes any mapping for that datagram flow.

   If the request includes a Server-Connection-Id header, the proxy is
   receiving a request to allow the client to forward packets to the
   target.  If the pair of this Server Connection ID and the client-
   facing socket on which the request was received does not create a
   conflict, the proxy creates the mapping and responds with a 200 (OK)
   response.  Once the successful response is sent, the proxy will
   forward any short header packets received on the client-facing socket
   that use the Server Connection ID using the correct server-facing
   socket.  If the pair is not unique, the server responds with a 409
   (Conflict) response.  If this occurs, traffic for that Server
   Connection ID can only use tunnelled mode, not forwarded.

   If the proxy does not support forwarded mode, or does not allow
   forwarded mode for a particular client or authority by policy, it can
   reject requests that include the Server-Connection-Id header with a
   response to indicate the error, such as 403 (Forbidden).

   Any successful (2xx) response MUST also echo any Client-Connection-
   Id, Server-Connection-Id, and Datagram-Flow-Id headers included in
   the request.

   The proxy MUST only forward non-tunnelled packets from the client
   that are QUIC short header packets (based on the Header Form bit) and
   have mapped Server Connection IDs.  Packets sent by the client that
   are forwarded SHOULD be considered as activity for restarting QUIC's
   Idle Timeout [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].

5.1.  Removing Mapping State

   Each CONNECT-UDP request consumes one bidirectional HTTP/3 stream.
   For any stream on which the proxy has sent a response indicating
   success, any mappings for the request last as long as the stream is
   open.

   A client that no longer wants a given Connection ID to be forwarded
   by the proxy, for either direction, MUST cancel its CONNECT-UDP
   HTTP/3 request [I-D.ietf-quic-http].

   If a client's connection to the proxy is terminated for any reason,
   all mappings associated with all requests are removed.

   A proxy can close its server-facing socket once all datagram flows
   mapped to that socket have been removed.

6.  Example

   Consider a client that is establishing a new QUIC connection through
   the proxy.  It has selected a Client Connection ID of 0x31323334.  It
   selects the next open datagram flow ID (2).  In order to inform a
   proxy of the new QUIC Client Connection ID, and bind that connection
   ID to datagram flow 2, the client sends the following CONNECT-UDP
   request:

   HEADERS
   :method = CONNECT-UDP
   :authority = target.example.com:443
   client-connection-id = :MTIzNA==:
   datagram-flow-id = 2

   The client will also send the initial QUIC packet with the Long
   Header form in a DATAGRAM frame with flow ID 2.

   Once the proxy sends a 200 response indicating success, packets
   received by the proxy that match the Connection ID 0x31323334 will be
   directly forwarded to the client.  The proxy will also forward the
   initial QUIC packet received on DATAGRAM flow 2 to
   target.example.com:443.

   When the proxy receives a response from target.example.com:443 that
   has 0x31323334 as the Destination Connection ID, the proxy will
   forward that packet to the client on DATAGRAM flow 2.

   Once the client learns which Connection ID has been selected by the
   target server, it can send a new request to the proxy to establish a
   mapping.  In this case, that ID is 0x61626364.  The client sends the
   following request:

   HEADERS
   :method = CONNECT-UDP
   :authority = target.example.com:443
   server-connection-id = :YWJjZA==:
   datagram-flow-id = 2

   The client also sends its reply to the target server in a DATAGRAM
   frame on flow 2 after sending the new request.

   Once the proxy sends a 200 response indicating success, packets sent
   by the client that match the Connection ID 0x61626364 will be
   forwarded to the target server, i.e., without proxy decryption.

   Upon receiving the response, the client starts sending Short Header
   packets with a Destination Connection ID of 0x61626364 directly to
   the proxy (not tunnelled), and these are forwarded directly to the
   target by the proxy.  Similarly, Short Header packets from the target
   with a Destination Connection ID of 0x31323334 are forwarded directly
   to the client.

7.  Interactions with Load Balancers

   Some QUIC servers are accessed using load balancers, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-quic-load-balancers].  These load balancers route packets
   to servers based on the server's Connection ID.  These Connection IDs
   are generated in a way that can be coordinated between servers and
   their load balancers.

   If a proxy that supports this extension is itself running behind a
   load balancer, extra complexity arises once clients start sending
   packets to the proxy that have Destination Connection IDs that belong
   to the end servers, not the proxy.  If the load balancer is not aware
   of these Connection IDs, or the Connection IDs overlap with other
   Connection IDs used by the load balancer, packets can be routed
   incorrectly.

   QUIC-aware CONNECT-UDP proxies generally SHOULD NOT be run behind
   load balancers; and if they are, they MUST coordinate between the
   proxy and the load balancer to create mappings for proxied Connection
   IDs prior to the proxy sending 2xx (Successful) responses to clients.

8.  Security Considerations

   Proxies that support CONNECT-UDP SHOULD provide protections to rate-
   limit or restrict clients from opening an excessive number of proxied
   connections, so as to limit abuse or use of proxies to launch Denial-
   of-Service attacks.

   Sending QUIC packets by forwarding through a proxy without tunnelling
   exposes some QUIC header metadata to onlookers, and can be used to
   correlate packets flows if an attacker is able to see traffic on both
   sides of the proxy.  Tunnelled packets have similar inference
   problems.  An attacker on both sides of the proxy can use the size of
   ingress and egress packets to correlate packets belonging to the same
   connection.  (Absent client-side padding, tunneled packets will
   typically have a fixed amount of overhead that is removed before
   their DATAGRAM contents are written to the target.)

   Since proxies that forward QUIC packets do not perform any
   cryptographic integrity check, it is possible that these packets are
   either malformed, replays, or otherwise malicious.  This may result
   in proxy targets rate limiting or decreasing the reputation of a
   given proxy.

   adversary is injecting malicious forwarded packets to induce rate
   limiting)

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  HTTP Headers

   This document registers the "Client-Connection-Id" and"Server-
   Connection-Id" headers in the "Permanent Message Header Field Names"
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers>.
